However, his conversion to Islam marked a turning point in Islamic military history. Once he embraced Islam, he never lost a single battle in over 100 engagements. His tactical genius was evident in battles like Muta, where he saved the Muslim army from complete destruction through brilliant maneuvering, and later in the conquest of Iraq and Syria. Khalid was known for his innovative battle strategies, including the famous pincer movement at the Battle of Yarmuk that led to a decisive victory against the Byzantine Empire. Despite his military prowess, he was humble and deeply religious. When Caliph Umar relieved him of command, fearing that people might start relying on Khalid instead of Allah, Khalid accepted the decision without complaint. He famously said on his deathbed that he regretted dying in bed rather than as a martyr in battle, showing his dedication to jihad in the path of Allah.",

But Bilal would only repeat 'Ahad, Ahad' (One, One), affirming his belief in the oneness of Allah. Abu Bakr eventually bought and freed him, and Bilal became one of the Prophet's closest companions. His beautiful, powerful voice led the Prophet to choose him as the first muezzin (caller to prayer) in Islam. The sound of Bilal's call to prayer became a symbol of the new faith. He was also the Prophet's personal attendant and treasurer, showing the trust placed in him. After the Prophet's death, Bilal was so grief-stricken that he could barely call the adhan, as it reminded him too much of his beloved Prophet. He moved to Syria where he lived until his death.

When he met the Prophet, he tested him with the signs he had been told about and became convinced that this was the final messenger. The Prophet helped arrange for his freedom, and Salman became a beloved companion. His most famous contribution was suggesting the digging of a trench around Medina during the Battle of the Trench (Khandaq), a Persian military tactic that saved the Muslim community.

This linguistic skill made him invaluable for communicating with Jewish and Christian communities. As the Prophet's chief scribe, Zaid wrote down the Quranic revelations as they came, ensuring their accurate preservation. After the Prophet's death, when many Quran memorizers were killed in the Battle of Yamama, Abu Bakr commissioned Zaid to compile the Quran into a single book. Later, during Uthman's caliphate, Zaid led the committee that created the standardized version of the Quran that we have today. His meticulous work and attention to detail ensured that the Quran was preserved exactly as it was revealed.

      "longBiography": "Hassan ibn Ali was the eldest son of Ali ibn Abi Talib and Fatimah, making him the Prophet's beloved grandson. The Prophet loved him dearly and often carried him on his shoulders during prayers. Hassan was known for his striking resemblance to the Prophet and his gentle, wise nature. When he became Caliph after his father's death, he faced a difficult situation with civil war threatening the Muslim community. In a remarkable act of wisdom and sacrifice, he gave up his position to Muawiya to prevent bloodshed among Muslims. This act of peacemaking earned him the title 'Sayyid Shabab Ahl al-Jannah' (Leader of the Youth of Paradise). Hassan was also known for his generosity - he gave away his wealth multiple times in his life and was famous for his beautiful recitation of the Quran. His decision to prioritize unity over power showed his deep understanding of Islamic values.",

      "longBiography": "Abu Hurairah, whose real name was Abd al-Rahman ibn Sakhr, got his nickname because he used to carry a small cat (hurairah means 'little cat' in Arabic) and was very kind to animals. He came to Islam relatively late, only three years before the Prophet's death, but he made the most of that time. He had an incredible memory and spent every possible moment with the Prophet, listening to his teachings and memorizing his words. While other companions were busy with trade or family, Abu Hurairah dedicated his life to learning. He narrated over 5,000 Hadiths, more than any other companion. The Prophet once prayed for Abu Hurairah's memory to be blessed, and after that, he never forgot anything he heard. He was very poor and often went hungry, but he chose knowledge over wealth. After the Prophet's death, he became one of the most important teachers in the Muslim community. His dedication to preserving the Prophet's teachings has benefited Muslims for over 1,400 years.",

The Prophet said 'The most knowledgeable of my Ummah in matters of halal and haram is Mu'adh ibn Jabal.' Despite his young age, the Prophet trusted him so much that he sent him to Yemen as a governor and teacher. Before he left, the Prophet gave him famous advice about how to judge between people, telling him to use the Quran first, then the Sunnah, then his own reasoning. This became a foundation for Islamic jurisprudence. Mu'adh was known for his deep understanding of the Quran, his beautiful recitation, and his ability to explain complex religious matters in simple terms. He was also very humble despite his knowledge and would often cry during his prayers out of fear of Allah. When he was dying of plague, he said he was happy to meet Allah and the Prophet. His students included many great scholars who spread his teachings throughout the Muslim world.",

      "longBiography": "Abdullah ibn Abbas was the Prophet's cousin and one of the greatest scholars in Islamic history. Known as 'Hibr al-Ummah' (The Scholar of the Ummah) and 'Tarjuman al-Quran' (The Interpreter of the Quran), he had an exceptional understanding of the Quran, Hadith, and Islamic law. The Prophet prayed for him saying 'O Allah, give him understanding in religion and teach him the interpretation of the Quran.' This prayer was clearly answered. Despite being very young when the Prophet died, Ibn Abbas had already shown remarkable intelligence and memory. He would follow the older companions and ask them about everything the Prophet said and did. He was known for his humility in seeking knowledge - he would wait outside the homes of companions to ask them questions, even though he was from a noble family. He became the go-to person for Quranic interpretation and Islamic law. His explanations and commentaries form the basis of much of our understanding of the Quran today. He lived a long life and taught thousands of students.",

The Prophet loved Usama so much that he called him 'my beloved, son of my beloved.' Despite being very young, Usama showed exceptional maturity, intelligence, and leadership skills. In one of his last acts, the Prophet appointed 18-year-old Usama as the commander of an army that included many older and more experienced companions like Abu Bakr and Umar. Some people questioned this decision because of his young age, but the Prophet defended his choice and said that Usama was worthy of leadership just as his father had been. This appointment showed that in Islam, leadership is based on merit, character, and ability, not just age or social status. Usama proved the Prophet right by leading the expedition successfully after the Prophet's death. He was known for his bravery, wisdom beyond his years, and deep love for the Prophet. His story inspires young people to take on responsibility and shows that age should not be a barrier to leadership when someone has the right qualities.",
