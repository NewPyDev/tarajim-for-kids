                <h2>سمية بنت خياط</h2>
                <p class="biography-text">
                    Sumayyah bint Khayyat holds the extraordinary and eternally honored distinction of being the first martyr in Islamic history, a brave and principled woman whose unwavering faith and ultimate sacrifice established a powerful precedent for courage and steadfastness that would inspire countless Muslims throughout the centuries and demonstrate that the strength of one's convictions can transcend all considerations of personal safety, social status, and even life itself.
                </p>
                <p class="biography-text">
                    Born in Abyssinia (modern-day Ethiopia) during the latter half of the 6th century CE, Sumayyah came to Mecca where she met and married Yasir ibn Amir, a man who, like herself, came from outside the traditional Meccan tribal structure. Together, they built a modest but stable life in Mecca, raising their son Ammar ibn Yasir and establishing themselves as respected members of the diverse community of immigrants, freedmen, and allies who contributed to the city's commercial success.
                </p>
                <p class="biography-text">
                    When the Prophet Muhammad began receiving divine revelations and started preaching the message of Islam in Mecca around 610 CE, Sumayyah and her family were among the early converts who recognized the truth and beauty of the new faith and embraced it wholeheartedly despite the social and economic risks that such a decision entailed. For Sumayyah, who had experienced firsthand the limitations and injustices that characterized the treatment of women and foreigners in pre-Islamic Arabian society, the Islamic message of human equality, divine justice, and the inherent dignity of all people must have resonated deeply.
                </p>
                <p class="biography-text">
                    As the Muslim community grew and the Prophet's message became more widely known throughout Mecca, the opposition from the city's ruling tribes became increasingly organized and violent. Sumayyah and her family, as non-tribal converts who lacked the protection of powerful tribal connections, found themselves in an extremely vulnerable position when the persecution of Muslims began in earnest. The enemies of Islam developed systematic methods of torture and intimidation designed to force Muslims to renounce their faith, and these methods were particularly brutal when applied to those who lacked tribal protection.
                </p>
                <p class="biography-text">
                    Despite the excruciating pain and the constant pressure to renounce her faith, Sumayyah demonstrated a level of courage and spiritual strength that amazed both her tormentors and her fellow Muslims. Her refusal to compromise her beliefs or speak against Islam and the Prophet Muhammad, even when faced with the most severe physical abuse and the threat of death, established her as a model of faith and steadfastness that would inspire generations of Muslims facing persecution and hardship. The Prophet Muhammad himself witnessed Sumayyah's suffering and was deeply moved by her courage and dedication, promising her that Paradise awaited those who remained steadfast in their faith despite persecution.
                </p>
                <p class="biography-text">
                    When Sumayyah's tormentors finally realized that no amount of physical abuse or psychological pressure would shake her faith or force her to renounce Islam, they made the decision to kill her, making her the first person to die for the Islamic faith and establishing her as the first martyr in Islamic history. Her death was not merely a personal tragedy but a pivotal moment in the early development of Islam, demonstrating both the seriousness of the opposition that the Muslim community faced and the depth of commitment that the faith could inspire in its followers.
